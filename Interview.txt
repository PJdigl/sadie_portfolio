Mock Interview Feedback 30th January 2024

Student: Sadie Groves

Interviewers: Mary Campbell Curriculum Team Leader, John Das Lecturer

Scenario: University

UAL Central Saint Martins BA (Hons) Fine Art

Sadie had provided a digital portfolio ahead of the interview.

Sadie presented as confident, engaged and serious about her choice to study Fine Art. When asked about why she wanted to study here she was not able to elaborate on the University choice or course/course structure which should be addressed if interview takes place due to the prestigious and highly sought after University and course.

Sadie gave confident and fluent answers to all other questions citing qualities she would bring to a course, examples of times she had applied the full range of creative problem solving skills to her own projects and her motivations for creative work.

Sadie presented a very good portfolio with good images, although text was too heavy and distracting, could use a smaller font or cut down, this could be University stipulation however.

Sadie spoke in depth about her portfolio ideas relating to her own personal journey of identity in an engaging way with clear reasoning and resolve shown in the work. As this was the main/sole theme of the portfolio explanations could be more succinct and could risk pigeon holing her as an artist or as somebody with the scope to explore alternative ideas. Later in the interview she spoke convincingly about her broad attitude and approach to ongoing explorations and criticism.

Sadie gave great examples of the work of others and her other external inspirations when questioned and was able to knowledgeably elaborate on the work of Cindy Sherman who was mentioned by John, this was impressive and cemented her assured presentation.

An excellent interview
