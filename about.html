            Now im sure you can imagine that THIS is a question ive asked myself alot, so this wont be to hard. <br>
            <br>
            My name is Sadie I am a 17 year old Trans Women. I was born in and live/study in South East London, I like
            music, art, cats and a whole other smattering of things. <br>
            <br>
            At the moment the purpose of my art is to
            not only express my emotions around my transition and relating topics around it (clothing, body dysphoria,
            love, family), but to also make the viewer of the art feel the same awkwardness and lack of comfort I feel
            on a day to day basis. I also attempt to utalise this uncomfort to protray a feeling of relatability for any
            viewers of my art who go through similar struggles.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>I have a large array of experience in using programs such as Blender, Photoshop, Clip Studio Paint, Ableton
          Live, Sony Vegas and other software with large creative uses and potential.<br>
          <br>
          I have also explored many distinct creative outlets during my studies. <br>
          <br>
          Some highlights include Silk Screen Printing, Life Drawing, Acrylics, Costume Construction & Design, Graphic &
          Logo Design, Architectural Design & Urban Planning, Mixed Media works and Collaging.<br>
          <br>
          I am very interested and open to exploring different mediums and techniques for creating new and experimental
          artwork.

        <p>Why i make art</p>
        <p>copy statement, add more</p>
        <p>Other creative outlets i use</p>
        <p>Aside from art my remaining creativity goes into my musical endevors In my free time, I even dabble with
          purchasing and repairing broken technology.
          <br> However, no matter how many outlets for
          creating I investigate, I always come back to creating purely expressive fine art.
