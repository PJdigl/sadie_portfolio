              Now I'm sure you can imagine that THIS is a question I've asked
              myself alot, so this wont be to hard. <br />
              <br />
              My name is Sadie I am a 17 year old trans women. I was born in and
              live/study in South East London, I like music, art, cats and a
              whole other smattering of things. <br />
              <br />
              At the moment, the purpose of my art is to not only express my
              emotions around my transition and other topics related to it, such
              as clothing, body dysphoria, love and family.<br />
              But to also make the viewer of the art feel the same awkwardness
              and lack of comfort I feel on a day to day basis. Simaltaniously
              attempting to utalise this uncomfort to protray a feeling of
              relatability for any viewers of my art who go through similar
              struggles as I am reguarding self presentation.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            I have a large array of experience in using programs such as
            Blender, Photoshop, Clip Studio Paint, Ableton Live, Sony Vegas and
            other software with large creative uses and potential.<br />
            <br />
            I have also explored many distinct creative outlets during my
            studies. <br />
            <br />
            Some highlights include Silk Screen Printing, Life Drawing,
            Acrylics, Costume Construction & Design, Graphic & Logo Design,
            Architectural Design & Urban Planning, Mixed Media works and
            Collaging.<br />
            <br />
            I am very interested and open to exploring different mediums and
            techniques for creating new and experimental artwork.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aside from art my remaining creativity goes into my musical endevors
            In my free time, I even dabble with purchasing and repairing broken
            technology. <br />
            However, no matter how many outlets for creating I investigate, I
            always come back to creating purely expressive fine art.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the future in reguards to my artwork, I want to be able to earn a
            living off of my creations, empowering younger trans people, to show
            that we can live, that we can grow old, that we can love, that we
            can change. And that we are powerfull and we are many.
