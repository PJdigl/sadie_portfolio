            To finish off this unit, our final task, (aside from the creation of
            this progression log) was to partake in a mock interview. <br />
            <br />
            Now, with me choosing to opt for multiple Universities while filling
            out my UCAS application, I was tasked with picking one of these Unis
            for the mock interview to portray. <br />
            <br />
            For this I decided to go with University Of the Arts London. <br />
            <br />
            <b>
              Below are the notes from the aforementioned mock interview, which
              took place the 30th of January 2024.

          <p>
            As stated in the mock interview review. I have 2 things that I need
            to improve on. <br />
            <br />
            1. My research on universities, the facilities they offer, how the
            course is structured, ect.<br />
            <br />
            2. Broadening on where I gather my inspirations from when it comes
            to art. Instead of gathering all of my ideas from inside myself, a
            limited resource, I should try to broaden my horizons and take and
            actively search out inspiration from other artists.<br />
            <br />
            3. To lessen the the amount of text in my portfolios provided.<br />
            <br />
            Going into university, upcoming interviews, and my furthering
            artistic endeavors, I will keep these criticisms in mind, hoping to
            better my chances at getting into university and to better my
            artistic outcomes.
