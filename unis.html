          For my university choices I had a few criterias... <br>
          <br>
          1. Them being releatively well known for having a good art course. <br>
          <br>
          2. Having a good policy when it comes to the treatment of LGBTQ+ students and facilities for students with
          physical or mental disabilities. <br>
          <br>
          3. A good mixture of Universities where I have to commute, and where I have to go into student
          accommodation.<br>
          <br>
          These are the universities that met those criterias for me!

            Goldsmiths, Univeristy of London<br>
            <br>
            Goldsmiths is a leading UK university for the arts.
            It offers undergraduate and postgraduate degrees from its campus situated in South East London, which makes
            it the perfectly
            commutable for me. <br>
            <br>
            With its campus sporting student facilities such as a librarys, councillers and places to eat.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          And for art has casting, constructed textiles, digital media, fine art printmaking, metalwork, photography,
          print and dye, stitch and fabric and woodwork facilities are avalible <br>
          <br>
          These facilities matched with its high prestige and LGBTQ+ students network as part of the students union,
          this makes it a great choice for me.

        </div>
        <p>
          I have applied to study at their Central Saint Martins Campus, again this is yet another college with a wide
          breadth of art and student facilities, aswell as a good policy on the treatment of LGBTQ+ students and is my
          second choice of commutable universities.
