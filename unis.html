          <b> For my university choices I had a few criteria... <br /> </b>
          <br />
          1. Them being relatively well known for having a good art course.
          <br />
          <br />
          2. Having a good policy when it comes to the treatment of LGBTQ+
          students and facilities for students with physical or mental
          disabilities. <br />
          <br />
          3. A good mixture of Universities where I have to commute, and where
          I have to go into student accommodation.<br />
          <br />
          These are the universities that met those criteria for me!
        </p>
        <div class="flex-container-right">
          <img src="images/Unis/Goldsmiths.jpg" class="flex-image" loading="lazy" />
          <p>
            <b>Goldsmiths, University of London<br /> </b>
            <br />
            Goldsmiths is a leading UK university for the arts. It offers
            undergraduate and postgraduate degrees from its campus situated in
            South East London, which makes it the perfectly commutable for me.
            <br />
            <br />
            With its campus sporting student facilities such as a libraries,
            councilors and places to eat.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          And for art has casting, constructed textiles, digital media, fine
          art printmaking, metalwork, photography, print and dye, stitch and
          fabric and woodwork facilities are available <br />
          <br />
          These facilities matched with its high prestige and LGBTQ+ students
          network as part of the students union, this makes it a great choice
          for me.

            <b>University of the Arts London<br /></b>
            <br />
            The University of the Arts London is a group of universities in
            the United Kingdom. It specialises in arts, design, fashion, and
            the performing arts.<br />
            <br />
            The university is a federation of six arts colleges: Camberwell
            College of Arts, Central Saint Martins, Chelsea College of Arts,
            the London College of Communication, the London College of Fashion
            and the Wimbledon College of Arts.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          I have applied to study at their Central Saint Martins Campus, again
          this is yet another college with a wide breadth of art and student
          facilities, as well as a good treatment of LGBTQ+ and neurodivergant
          students. It is also my second choice of commutable universities.
        </p>

            the Creative Arts in 2008), the group of universities are well
            known for their highly praised creative courses and facilities.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          I have even been sent an email from them, asking for details on my
          needs regarding my disabilities! Something no other University I
          have applied to has done!
        </p>
        <div class="flex-container-left">

            <b> University of Reading<br /> </b>
            <br />
            The University of Reading is a public research university in
            Reading, Berkshire, England. It was founded in 1892 as University
            College, Reading, a University of Oxford extension college.<br /><br />
            While not commonly known for their art courses, after doing my
            research online I have heard good things about them!<br />
            Hoping that this is another good option for my future university.

            Bath College of Higher Education, and later Bath Spa University
            College.<br /><br />
            Yet again, I've done my research, hopefully I've done enough and
            not missed anything.

        <p>
          <b>When it comes to what University I will actually choose?<br />
          </b>
          <br />
          I'm not sure, it all depends who gives me offers, if I want to stay
          home instead of going away and just general personal bias.<br />
          <br />
          It's only a matter of time, I'm excited to further pursue my
          artistic endeavors.
