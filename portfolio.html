          Here you can view a series of art peices all created around the brief
          of decay and learn about my reasoning and inspiration behind each
          peice. These peices will cover my thoughts and feelings about myself,
          my social/medical transition and experiences with love. These peices
          will also be presented in chronological order! <br />
          <br />

          Ill do my best to keep you in the loop about where we are
          chronologically and how each peice intertwines!

            Self Portrait 1<br /><br />
            Originally when this peice was first being created it was destined
            to be chopped up and sliced for a collage...<br /><br />
            But. As i continued to work on the peice i started to realise not
            only how much i love the texture of charcoal on canvas but also my
            own opinion on my face changed drasitcally from negative to
            positive. While it may only be a simple self portrait I dont think
            id have the more positive self image i have today writing this.
