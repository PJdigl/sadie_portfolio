            Here you can view a series of art peices all created around the
            brief of decay and learn about my reasoning and inspiration behind
            each peice. These peices will cover my thoughts and feelings about
            myself, my social/medical transition and experiences with love.
            Aswell as showcasing some smaller peices, giving a view into the
            experimentation I take part in between larger more meaningfull
            peices. <br />

              "It's so hard to depict a body I don't like. My only references
              are photos from my phone, they're inaccurate. To meet the
              standards of a perfect reflection. It almost seems impossible.

              Charcoal on Canvas<br />
              A4 2023<br />
              <br />
              Originally when this peice was first being created it was destined
              to be chopped up and sliced for a collage...<br />
              <br />
              But. As i continued to work on the peice i started to realise not
              only how much i love the texture of charcoal on canvas but also my
              own opinion on my face changed drasitcally from negative to
              positive. While it may only be a simple self portrait I dont think
              id have the more positive self image i have today writing this.

              <br />
              After completing (and wowing myself) with the self-portrait, I
              decided to move onto another piece about another insecurity of
              mine. I have a problem with my ribs, caused by me wearing
              ill-fitting bras and sleeping in them early transition. This has
              caused one half of my ribs to jut out slightly further than the
              other half. I had a lot of ideas surrounding this piece, shown in
              the sketches on this slide, but as you'll see, I eventually
              settled on something a bit more grounded in reality.

              <br />
              Another one of my life drawing peices done this year.
              <br />
              <br />
              A life drawing peice depicting a man resting on a metal pole, the
              same pole shown in the previous life drawing peice.<br />
              More emphisis and time was spent on capturing the lighting of the
              scene within the peice and how it interacts with the figure.<br />
              <br />
              Notice the level of shading especially around the upper half of
              the body and the stomach, with thicker more abrasive lines used
              for the darker areas in most places.

              Charcoal on Paper<br />
              A3 2023<br />
              <br />
              The third and final life drawing piece within this progression
              log.<br />
              With this art piece, in my opinion, being the strongest of the
              three.<br />
              <br />
              This piece relies less on details and experimentation with light
              and shadow, instead opting to let the posing of the figures and
              more stylized nature of the piece stand out as a more striking
              approach than the other life drawing pieces.<br />
              <br />
              The choices of poses in this piece are also deliberate, with one
              being closed off, protecting its torso and blocking you off with
              its forearm, and the other pose being vulnerable and open. Its
              torso unprotected, arms locked together above its head.<br />
              This helps to bring juxtaposition to the piece using just body
              language.

              What A Fool<br />
              Charcoal on Canvas<br />
              A4 2023<br />
              <br />
              A piece showing my feelings about a recent romantic experience I
              missed.<br />
              <br />
              For this piece I wanted to incorporate the feelings around missing
              that chance into some of my art, I also decided to simplify my own
              protrayal in these peices, I am not trans, I am not
              neurodivergant, I am just a women, wanting another. My solution
              was to depict myself as a steriotypical female stick figures,
              probably the most basic depiction of a women I can think of,
              making the representation of gender in the piece more binary, more
              relatable.

              most of my work so far that year had been constrained to A4 pieces
              of paper, so for my next piece, I wanted to go bigger and bolder,
              so I decided the best candidate for this experimentation, was
              another self portrait.
