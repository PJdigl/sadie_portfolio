    Here you can view a series of art peices all created around the brief of decay and learn
    about my reasoning and inspiration behind each peice. These peices will cover my thoughts
    and feelings about myself, my social/medical transition and experiences with love. These
    peices will also be presented in chronological order! <br> <br>

    Ill do my best to keep you in the loop about where we are chronologically and how each peice intertwines!</p>

    Self Portrait 1<br><br>
    Originally when this peice was first being created it was destined to be chopped up and sliced for a collage...<br><br> But. As
    i continued to work on the peice i started to realise not only how much i love the texture of charcoal on canvas but
    also my own opinion on my face changed drasitcally from negative to positive. While it may only be a simple self
    portrait I dont think id have the more positive self image i have today writing this.
