              Originally when this piece was first being created it was destined
              to be chopped and sliced up for a collage...<br />
              <br />
              But. As I continued to work on the piece I started to realise not
              only how much I love the texture of charcoal on canvas, but I also
              noticed my own opinion on my face change drastically from negative
              to positive. While it may only be a simple self portrait I don't
              think id have the more positive self image I have today writing
              this. If I had not created it.<br />
              <br />
              This art is a part of me now, my transition, it can never be
              removed.

              For another art piece I decided to move onto another insecurity of
              mine. I have a problem with my ribs, caused by me wearing
              ill-fitting bras and sleeping in them early transition. This has
              caused one half of my ribs to jut out slightly further than the
              other half. I had a lot of ideas surrounding this piece,
              eventually deciding to use my ribs as a representation of how I
              don't fit in with societies norms.<br />
              <br />
              "Would I have this self hate if there was nothing to conform
              to?<br />
              <br />
              Would I be happy with myself? <br />
              <br />
              I don't know if I can tell what "improvements" are forced or of my
              own volition"

              A life drawing piece depicting a masculine figure in the

              Another one of my life drawing pieces done this year.
              <br />
              <br />
              A life drawing piece depicting a man resting on a metal pole, the
              same pole shown in the previous life drawing piece.<br />
              More emphasis and time was spent on capturing the lighting of the
              scene within the piece and how it interacts with the figure.<br />
              <br />
              Notice the level of shading especially around the upper half of
              the body and the stomach, with thicker more abrasive lines used
              for the darker areas in most places.

              The third and final life drawing piece within this progression
              log.<br />
              With this art piece, in my opinion, being the strongest of the
              three.<br />
              <br />
              This piece relies less on details and experimentation with light
              and shadow, instead opting to let the posing of the figures and
              more stylized nature of the piece stand out as a more striking
              approach than the other life drawing pieces.<br />
              <br />
              The choices of poses in this piece are also deliberate, with one
              being closed off, protecting its torso and blocking you off with
              its forearm, and the other pose being vulnerable and open. Its
              torso unprotected, arms locked together above its head.<br />
              This helps to bring juxtaposition to the piece using just body
              language.

              A piece showing my feelings about a recent romantic experience I
              missed.<br />
              <br />
              For this artwork I wanted to incorporate the feelings around
              missing that chance, I also decided to simplify my own portrayal
              in this piece, I am not trans, I am not neurodivergant, I am just
              a women, wanting another.<br />
              <br />
              This decision ended up turning into the idea that i was to depict
              myself as a stereotypical female stick figure, probably the most
              basic depiction of a women I can think of, making the
              representation of gender in the piece more binary, more relatable.
              <br /><br />
              The place depicted in the art is where I found out that I had
              missed that romantic experience.

              Most of my work so far that year had been constrained to A4 pieces
              of paper, so for my next piece, I wanted to go bigger and bolder,
              so I decided the best candidate for this experimentation, was
              another self portrait. <br />
              <br />
              This is probably the piece I spent the most time on this year, and
              definitely my favorite self portrait I have created out of the
              two.

              A piece about my ongoing transition, stuck between male and
              female, both sides pulling me equally.<br />
              <br />
              This piece depicts my body at the time of creating it, my breast
              development just starting, my flared ribs out in the open, body
              hair, it is unapologetic not only to myself, but to all the
              viewers.<br /><br />
              Don't look away now, feel my shame.<br />
              <br />
              This piece is also my peak so far in terms of shading and colour,
              colour especially being something absent from the majority of my
              pieces this year. It's used to show a sense of hope, of finality,
              that I am over the hill that is starting hormones, legally I am
              Sadie, and soon my physical form shall match my name.
