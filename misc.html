          <p>
            For this progression log we were asked to create either a powerpoint
            presentation, or (what I chose) a website!<br />
            <br />
            Now, with me wanting to learn how to code in html and css, and also
            not wanting to fall into the trap of a website builder such as
            Squarespace. this was the perfect opportunity for me to learn how to
            create my own website! So off I went to find a free hosting
            service...
          </p>
          <p>
            To create this website I first attempted to host it on a service known
            as Neocities...
          </p>
          <img src="./images/neocities.png" class="flex-image" loading="lazy" />
          <p>
            Now at first this was going great! <br />
            <br />
            I was learning basic html, how to add text, how to add images, how
            to link different pages, how to embed links and videos and getting
            the foundation of what I wanted of the to be website down! <br />
            <br />
            <h1>
              Then Neocities deleted my account for spam.
            </h1>
            So, with Neocities out of the question, I decided this time I was
            going to do things properly and make a github repository for my
            work, editing it through Visual Studio Code. <br />
            <br />
            </p>
            <img src="./images/code.png" class="flex-image" loading="lazy" />
            <a href="https://github.com/PJdigl/sadie_portfolio">
              (Here's the link to my repository if you feel so inclined to have
              a look around at my code!)
            </a>
          <p>
            And now, four months and alot of learning later, here's my final
            product, the very website you're navigating around!<br />
            <br />
            Also have a try navigating around on a mobile phone, I tried my hardest
            to make things work on all devices!
